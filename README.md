### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vyacheslav (or Slava for short). Here I try to learn game development by implementing my own game engine, using C++ and system-specific APIs.
My first goal was to detatch from SDL library, but also make more usable engine architecture.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my project 'asuka', where I learn system-specific APIs like Win32, XAudio2, Posix, Alsa, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OpenGL rendering side of things
