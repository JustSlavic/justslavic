### Hi 👋

My name is Vyacheslav (or Slava for short). Here I try to learn game development by implementing my own game engine, using C++ and system-specific APIs.
My first goal was to detatch from SDL library, but also make more usable engine architecture.

- 🔭 I work on my project 'asuka', where I learn system-specific APIs like Win32, XAudio2, Posix, Alsa, etc.
- 🌱 I learn rendering using OpenGL and Direct3D 11, understanding graphics pipeline, projection matrix, and shaders more deeply.
- ⚙️ I also develop compiler in pure C, no CRT, on a RaspberryPi.
